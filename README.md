# CodingTrainChallengeOpenGL
I'll try to add an OpenGL version of the marvellous Coding Challenges made by Daniel Shieffman on his youtube channel

His channel is really amazing, I've learnt a lot and enjoyed coding, I suggest you also to check his books!

In this project I try to replicate some of his challanges and porting them from Processing/P5JS to C++ and OpenGL.
I've uploaded all the neccessaries to test the project, you just need Visual Studio Community then download the files and open the solution! I'm not an expert of C++ and OpenGL and I'm trying to learn them, so be careful with learning from my code!
